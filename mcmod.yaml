# Paths to copy to the target directory
# Each path will be copied to target/{path}. If you want to customize the path in target, use [src, dst]
# This is useful if you need to override some files in the template, for example dependencies.gradle
# Directories will be scanned recursively.

# use "null" as the source to delete a file or directory in the target
# deletion will happen before copying
