# FastLeafDecay
This is a fork of the [FastLeafDecay](https://github.com/Olafski/FastLeafDecay) mod by Olafski, Since the original repo has its code deleted for some reason.

All derived work from the original mod is licensed under the MIT license.

Below is the original README.md file. It's pretty old and some links may not work
---
A simple Minecraft mod that speeds up leaf decay after you cut down the wood in a tree. Generally it will only take about five seconds before all leaves are gone.

## Download
Download the source code from right here, or get the jar version from [CurseForge](http://minecraft.curseforge.com/mc-mods/230976-fastleafdecay).

## Discuss
Comments are welcome on CurseForge or in the [MinecraftForum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2196219-fastleafdecay-leaves-be-gone). Bug reports may also be entered here on GitHub.

## Requirements
* Minecraft 1.7.10
* [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/) version 10.13.0.1199 or higher
 
Only servers need to have this mod, so if you're playing on a server that has it installed you will not need to install it on the client.

## Compatibility
This mod will speed up leaf removal of trees from the following mods, in addition to the default Minecraft trees:
* Natura
* IndustrialCraft 2
* Minefactory Reloaded

## Known (compatibility) issues
This mod is not compatible with RandomThings, as they both modify the leaves block.

## Modpacks
Feel free to add this mod to your pack. No permission required! I would appreciate a line in [the MinecraftForum thread though](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2196219-fastleafdecay-leaves-be-gone).

## Credits
[Lumien](https://github.com/lumien231) for making the Random Things mod. I took nearly all of the code for this mod from that one:
